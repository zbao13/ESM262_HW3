This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Example Data
```{r}
fish_price_1 <- matrix(c(16,14,10,25,20), nrow = 5, ncol = 1, byrow = T,
                       dimnames = list(c("lingcod","rockfish","sole","halibut","yellowtail"),
                                       c("price")))
fish_price_1

fish_catch_1 <- matrix(c(23,15,10,3,14, 120,140,20,120,60, 40,55,23,13,9, 7,25,13,42,22,11,23,13,15,66), nrow = 5, ncol = 5, byrow = T,
                       dimnames = list(c("lingcod","rockfish","sole","halibut","yellowtail"),
                                         c("SB","VTA","LA","OC","SD")))
fish_catch_1
setwd("/Users/zbao/Desktop/ZBao_HW3")
save(fish_price_1, file = "fish_price_1.rda")
save(fish_catch_1, file = "fish_catch_1.rda")
```
Fuction
Equation 1
```{r}
fish_summary = function(price,catch, plot = F){
  most_fish = list(colnames(catch), rownames(catch)[apply(catch, 2, which.max)])
  total_rev = sum(price[,1] * catch)
  loc_rev = price[,1] * catch
  loc_rev = colSums(loc_rev)
  loc_rev_df = data.frame(loc_rev)
  loc_rev_df$location = c(rownames(loc_rev_df))
   if (plot) {
     lb = sprintf("The total revenue is %d dollars", total_rev)
     p = ggplot(loc_rev_df, aes(location, loc_rev, fill=location))+geom_col()+
     labs(y="revenue in dollars")+annotate("text", x=2, y=5000, label=lb, col="red")
   }
   else p=NULL
return(list(MostFrequent = most_fish, TotalRevenue = total_rev, Revenue_by_Location = loc_rev_df, plot = p))
  }

```

Example 1
```{r}
fish_summary(fish_price_1, fish_catch_1,plot = T)
```

Equation 2

```{r}
growth_rate = function(a,b,c,d,temp){
  G <- (a+b*temp+c*temp^2+d*temp^3)
  return(G)
}
```
Example 2
```{r}
growth_rate(-0.497,0.1656,0.08588,-0.004266,14.3)

```

Test
```{r}
library(testthat)

test1 <- test_that("fish_summary_works",{expect_that(fish_summary(fish_price_1,fish_catch_1)$TotalRevenue > 5000, is_true())})
test1

test2<-test_that("growth_rate_test", {expect_that(growth_rate(-.497,0.1656,0.08588,-.004266,14.3)>0, is_true())})
test2

```
